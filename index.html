									<br> As a recently graduated games programming student, I am eagerly seeking to make my mark in the gaming industry.
									My primary areas of expertise lie in C# and Unity, but I also have some experience with Unreal and C++.
									Throughout my educational journey and personal pursuits, I have completed multiple projects, each serving as a testament to my passion and growth as a programmer.
									This portfolio serves as a showcase for my work, highlighting the diverse range of projects I have developed.

								<p>
									BYLE is the most intricate game I've worked on. With plans to soon go on Steam and having been presented at the Insomnia gaming festival, BYLE is something I am very proud of.
									I worked on it in a group, and my major roles in development were procedural generation, the shop systems, the tutorial, the encyclopedia, room management, various shaders and sound implementation.
									Additionally, I collaborated with a teammate to implement the enemies into the game using AI and also designed the models and animations for the majority of the game's enemies.
									I was also involved in the player controller, game manager, and weapons. I learned a lot while developing BYLE and see it as the culmination of all my work to this point.
									I put so much work into this project and could talk about its benefits to me as a programmer at greater depth, though I am conscious about space management in this portfolio.

								<p>
									Pillow Fight is an exhilarating 4-player party game where players compete to collect the most chickens and emerge victorious.
									As the lead programmer for this group project, I spearheaded key elements including
									chicken logic, player controllers, controller input, spawning systems, object pooling manager, menu systems, and level integration.
									This experience provided valuable insights into teamwork dynamics, allowing me to gain a deeper appreciation for the power of collaboration,
									idea sharing, and mutual learning.
									This project stands as a testament to my dedication and ability to contribute to successful collaborative endeavors.

								<p>
									Cabbage Chaos posed a set of unique challenges as the specification for the project was to create a game that utilized voice controls as inputs.
									Working alongside the other programmers on the team, we successfully implemented voice recognition in Unity, binding key words to a car controller.
									Developing a car controller in Unity turned out to be more challenging than I initially anticipated, 
									and I took on the responsibility of creating the controller. I prototyped several car designs, 
									eventually settling on the one used in the game, and I am pleased with the final result.
									Additionally, I worked on the cabbage logic within the game, the waypoint spawns for the vehicle's travel path, the menu system,
									and even contributed to the level design.

                                    As part of my research assignment exploring the advantages of modern-day procedural terrain generators compared to traditional human-made terrain,
                                    I developed my own generator. The objective was to create a tool that could be utilized by designers,
                                    so I implemented a user interface (UI) that allowed adjustable variables for all aspects of the terrain generation.
                                    This functionality is demonstrated in the accompanying video.
                                    In addition to the program itself, I supported my research assignment with a comprehensive paper. 
									Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of procedural generation and its relevance in the modern industry. 
									It provided valuable insights into the potential of procedural terrain generation and its ability to revolutionize the way terrain is created 
									and utilized.

									This assignment at university required us to create a retro game utilizing an SDL framework.
									The project presented several challenging aspects, including setting up the SDL engine, working with the C++ language,
									which was relatively new to me at that time,
									and implementing the game logic for Frogger. This involved developing the game loop, controlling the frog,
									handling the spawning of logs and cars, and creating the menu system.
									Recreating a classic game provided a valuable learning experience as it allowed me to explore how other programmers approach game development,
									which in turn influenced my own work. I also drew all the pixel art for the sprites, although I obviously had source images to use.

									I made this Pok√©mon game as one of the first games I developed that wasn't using Scratch. It was created using Windows Forms in Visual Studio,
									which presented a whole host of issues for game development since it wasn't its intended function.
									However, this game accomplishes a lot, and even though I made it a long time ago, I wanted to include it here as I believe it
									showcases my roots in game development and still holds up well.
									Obviously, it isn't as feature-complete as a full Pok√©mon game, but it includes a 2D overworld controller, 
									warp zones, environment (I drew all the environment assets), NPCs, dialogue, battling, encounters, catching, and a complex menu system for managing Pok√©mon.
									I want to take a moment to clarify that I don't own Pok√©mon, so please don't sue me Nintendo.
