                                <br> As a recently graduated games programming student, I am eagerly seeking to make my mark in the gaming industry.
                                My primary areas of expertise lie in C# and Unity, but I also have some experience with Unreal and C++.
                                Throughout my educational journey and personal pursuits, I have completed multiple projects, each serving as a testament to my passion and growth as a programmer.
                                This portfolio serves as a showcase for my work, highlighting the diverse range of projects I have developed.

                        <h4>C#</h4>
                        <p>I've been coding in C# for about 6 years now, I started coding for my studies in A-levels and have took it much further since then. Initially did most my work in visual studio with windows forms but graduated to working in unity</p>

                                                        <br>BYLE was created as a final year project at University to demonstrate our ability and everything we had learnt over our time in education.
                                                        I worked in a team of 6 including both programmers and designers. The game has 2 game modes, infinitely looping rogue-like dungeon crawler where the player must move through an abandoned city
                                                        infected with a poisonous substance known as "BYLE" and also a colosseum game mode where a player fights hordes of enemies in a wave based combat mode with
                                                        a unique boss every 10 waves. Me and my team took BYLE to the Insomnia i70 gaming festival, and exhibited the game for people to play. As well as this,
                                                        we worked to make enough depth for BYLE to put the game on Steam, where it can now be played for free. Feel free to look at the Steam page, me and my team still make steam updates to this day!<br><br>

                                                        I created the games map generation and management of the rooms generated. This involved building the rooms that could be generated,
                                                        getting the rooms to spawn in from a hub point, making sure rooms can't collide with eachother (as they are all different sizes going in different directions),
                                                        and making sure there are key rooms spawned in such as boss rooms, shop rooms and other various unique rooms in the game.
                                                        <br><br>As well as this I programmed the cutscenes for entering specific rooms and also intergrating special room features and tracking them (such as when the room has been cleared of enemies,
                                                        whether the totem or shop in the room has been interacted, and spawning in rewards and opening up the map upon clearing a room).<br>

                                                    <p style="color:white ; font-size: 20px; text-align:left">
                                                        I created the colosseum as a new game mode to add depth to the game. I had a good foundation of elements to use as enemies, weapons and power up,
                                                        systems had already been put inplace to make it quite intuitive to add more content. BYLEs main game mode is a dungeon crawler where you must move through
                                                        levels clear out the random enmies, where as the colosseum is a wave based game mode where the enemies are the same everytime but the 100 waves have been
                                                        scaled to make it get harder as time passes.<br><br>

                                                        I made the entire colosseum logic and wave logic which included changing how BYLE worked as it was quite hard coded before as there was only one game mode,
                                                        as well as this I made over 20 new enemies, some new weapons and some new powerpower-ups to flesh out the game. The hardest part was scaling the difficulty
                                                        so that it doesnt fluctuate in how challenging it is.

                                                    <p style="color:white ; font-size: 20px; text-align:left">
                                                        The games shop system took a lot to implement also, as up to this point in development, there was no different state for the game to be in,
                                                        so I initialy started working on the game being in different states so that all the various scripts new how to react based on if the player was
                                                        active, in the shop or just paused. From there I made a new UI for the shop and created a dialogue system for the shop keeper, just to give him
                                                        some character.

                                                        <br><br>To add the weapons into the shop I decided instead of changing the existing weapon prefabs, that I would make new prefabs, which hosted some
                                                        key values for the shop to work such as price, description and rarity. I then had to implment a currency system into the game and tie it in to the shop.
                                                        The final step was to adjust the camera controller to have a cool lerp into the shop that changed the perspective and allowed it to become more visually
                                                        appealing. I added a easter egg also where the player could steal items from the shop, but doing so would result in the shop keeper fighting the player.

                                                        The Encyclopedia is a separate area of the game where the player can track progress. I added various features to it including the implementation of a achivement system
                                                        (that later would be tied to steam also), a tracker for all the various enemies, power ups and weapons the player has picked up, and then a cool visual display of the games content,
                                                        including hand tailored description of the each to build up some kind of lore.

                                                        <br><br> A lot of the difficulty with making this system was having the game save information that can be loaded when the game was reloaded, and then also the code for displaying
                                                        the enemies using various shaders to make them look great. The achivement systems implementation too was challenging, and working along side othet team members we came up witha strong implementation
                                                        that could save the nessasary statistics. The UI was also a slight pain to create and implement but I am happy with the end result.

                                                        <br>SOYL is a game that I worked on in a team for a month long game jam. The theme of the game jam was a farming game, but it had to have either a horror or a magical twist.
                                                        We went for a magical twist, and the concept of the game is that you are a wizard who also likes to farm, slime monsters will try to attack your barn so you must plant
                                                        magical crops to defend the barn from the monsters. We came second overall in the game jam which we were quite happy with as we all had jobs meaning we couldn't invest a surplus
                                                        of time into the development. The game is on Itch.io right now and can be played through the web without the need to download, feel free to take a look, its a simple fast pace
                                                        game that is quick to play and pick-up.

                                                        The grid system is used for player movement, placing plants and harvesting plants. The grid tracks where all of the objects
                                                        are and has functionality to check if theres a collision betwen whats on the gird and what the player chooses to do. Everything on
                                                        the grid has information that is kept in a database scriptable object. It allows different sizes of objects to go on the grid and take multiple positions.<br><br>

                                                        From having the grid and all the various functions and methods to access data from the grid (positions, adding and removing of objects), I then made
                                                        the visualisations for the grid using a shader, and had the mouse cursor interact with the grid, highlighting what the player hovers over. From there
                                                        it was just a matter of making the separate scripts for what to do when harvesting, moving or planting. Looking back this couldv'e been a switch statement
                                                        to avoid duplicating code, but it was a games jam after all.

                                                        The planting system essentially instantiates a prefab of the vegetable when its in its growing form. From its growing form
                                                        it grows every time the player moves and then eventually will emerge from the ground as a plant AI. I coded the funtionality for 
                                                        all the UI to make it so when the player clicks a plant button, it refrences the database scriptable object I mentioned earlier,
                                                        and gets the plant tied to the button. Each plant has a unique time to grow, as well as a unique cost, health and damage.<br><br>

                                                        When the plant grows in a little particle system plays and they lerp through the ground to emerge. From there the plant is added
                                                        to the grid system so so that the player and other AIs can no longer move into the space it is occupying. I also added a 2D shadow
                                                        material onto the plants so that there sprite renderer casts shadow onto the enviroment, adding to the visuals of the game. I then 
                                                        added more visual feedback to the UI and made info boxes that appear on hovering over the UI elements, so the player can see the plants
                                                        stats.

                                                        As this project was only a month long game jam a lot of focus was put into well polished and bug free features, as well as having the game look very visually appealing. My major rolls on the team was to do with the grid system, player movement, planting and harvesting. I didnt have much of a roll 
                                                        in the AIs code although helped to tie the AIs to the grid system and also gave some minor support to the AI programmers. Some other things I worked on include:

                                                        <br>Fishing game (currently a unnamed game) is a project I've been working on since completing University. My other major projects and games jams are normally done in a team, and while that is a extremely valuable expierence,
                                                        I thought it would be beneficial to have a solo project where everything is done by me, this will allow me to do things I normally wouldn't do, and allow me to set my own deadlines. I chose to make it a 2D pixel art game, so that I
                                                        can make all the assets alone, which as of now is what has taken the longest in development of this game. The concept for the game is that it will be a rythmn based fishing game, that has a vast array of fish to collect, and a 
                                                        procedurally generated enviroment, that has a randomly generated pool of fish. I have lots of ideas for this game that I plan to slowly implement.<br><br>

                                                        I decided to draw a fish every single day for 147 days. I am a programmer so pixel art isn't where my ambitions and interests lay, but I decided to do a fish every single day without fail, to demonstrate some discipline and to
                                                        make a good foundation for the game, so that I can now really sink my teeth into the code. As well as this, I have hand drawn every single element in this game, everything being used is pixel art created by me. This project is far from over but I will demonstrate what I have worked on so far.

                                                        I've worked on multiple procedural generators in the past, some of which are on this portfolio, but this one posed a challenge to me as initially, I didnt know how to get the generation to work with tiles in unity. After many hours of research, 
                                                        I managed to put together this, which as of currently can produce a land scape with pools and lakes that have banks of sand around them.<br><br>
                                                        
                                                        To do this, I have a script that loops through a initially blank terrain, and from each tile it randomly decides
                                                        where clumps of sand will be placed. These clumps of sand randomly expand, and then water is generated next inside of the clumps of sand. Each layer is put on their own tile map to keep things separate, but there is also a over arching tile map, which
                                                        pastes over itself, which is used later as a refrence for the tile rules, that make the terrain seemlessly transition together. The next step of the generation is to generate the ocean around the island, and then make a beach as well with a random length.
                                                        Finally, the vegetation is spawned in randomly in viable locations, and the vegetation is sorted into nessasary layers to interact with the player.<br><br>

                                                        As of now, I am happy with the generation, but in the future I plan to make it much more efficent, as currently it loops through code for too long which makes generation time longer than optimal. Also I want to add rivers and larger lakes that will make the enviroment more unique 
                                                        and offer more locations to fish. I may even add buildings depending on how I think the game feels. As well as all this, there needs to be some more checks to make sure there is no weird generation, that you may be able to pick up on by looking at the maps generated. But for the short term
                                                        I am happy with the generation.

                                                        The fishing loop is currently early on in development as I realised it would be better to create the fish scriptable object first, but for now I have made a sort of basic version of what I hope it looks like. The idea is that initially there is a casting phase, and a power slider for
                                                        how well the cast is, this will translate into the likely hood of catching a fish. From there if a fish is on the line, there is the rhythm game based phase, which will be where the player needs to hit every note on time to be able to catch the fish. The rhythms will be faster and harder based off of
                                                        the rarity of the fish. <br><br>

                                                        Currently, a lot of the initial code is in place, like the power slider code which is fully functional and returns a value back to the player controller. The rhythm game currently only ever spawns a set prefab of the rhythm, but in the future I want to make it randomly generated. As well as this the rhythm, game 
                                                        currently has no tie in to the rarity of the fish, because i transitioned from development of fishing, to the fish code.

                                                        The first challenge of making the player controller was drawing a sprite and a animation frame for every direction the player can move into. From there I made a script for the player controller that takes key inputs and moves the player in the direction requested using a coroutine to lerp the
                                                        players position, and refers to the animation controller to play the relevant animation.<br><br>

                                                        The player checks if the tile is is moving into is a accessable tile by casting a small 2D physics overlap circle and checking what layer the tile that the circle hits is in. There are different layers for waters and vegetation so that later down the line
                                                        I can make unique interactions such as fishing with the relevant tiles. I also made tile rules with animations for the various tiles around the player, so that animations can be played and seemless transitions between enviroments can take place, to make a better visual experience. currently
                                                        some of the tile rules need modifying, as certain cases are not being accounted for.

                                                        The fish scriptable object is what I am currently investing time into in development. It basically needs to be a place that can hold all types of information about the fish, including names and IDs, description (incase I want to make a encyclopedia type thing later down the line), sprites andanimation controllers
                                                        as the fish will need to paste its variables onto a existing placeholder for a fish. It also needs weight and size variables, just for display purposes, and finally it needs information on the fishes rarity and where the fish can be caught(sea, river or lake).<br><br>

                                                        Not only is making the class and using it taking time, but the main time cnsomer is creating all 147 fishes and adding the information on them. Once I have completed that though, I plan to make a fish pool for what fish can spawn in the game in what circumstances, but more will come on that in the future. Tying all
                                                        these variables into the current game loop as well also includes modifying a lot of scripts, but I hope to have this task finished soon.

                                                        <br>This assignment at university required us to create a retro game utilizing an SDL framework.
					                    				The project presented several challenging aspects, including setting up the SDL engine, working with the C++ language,
						                    			which was relatively new to me at that time,
						                    			and implementing the game logic for Frogger. This involved developing the game loop, controlling the frog,
						                    			handling the spawning of logs and cars, and creating the menu system.
						                    			Recreating a classic game provided a valuable learning experience as it allowed me to explore how other programmers approach game development,
						                    			which in turn influenced my own work. I also drew all the pixel art for the sprites, although I obviously had source images to use.

					                    				I developed my own generator. The objective was to create a tool that could be utilized by designers,
				                    					so I implemented a user interface (UI) that allowed adjustable variables for all aspects of the terrain generation.
					                    				This functionality is demonstrated in the accompanying video.
					                    				In addition to the program itself, I supported my research assignment with a comprehensive paper.
					                    				Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of procedural generation and its relevance in the modern industry.
						                    			It provided valuable insights into the potential of procedural terrain generation and its ability to revolutionize the way terrain is created
						                    			and utilized.
